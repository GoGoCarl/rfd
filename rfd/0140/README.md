# RFD 140 Conch: Datacenter Designer

## Overview

Conch is a datacenter management service. It supports validating various aspects of a datacenter deployment. However, it is currently difficult to manage regions, datacenters, and racks.

It would be extremely helpful if we had the ability to visually design a datacenter floor.

## Current Objects

In Conch, we have the following concepts:

* Regions
* Datacenter Rooms  / Availability Zones
* Racks
* Devices

### Regions

### Datacenter Rooms

### Racks

### Devices
